## About The Project

This is a simple Captcha tool that we created using the help of ChatGPT. The code should be simple enough to replicate and run on local host.  

Packages Needed to get started:
* Shiny
* Stringi

### Built With
* R Studio


#### Conclusion
* The tool is used only on local host and not an actual app that we were trying to create.
